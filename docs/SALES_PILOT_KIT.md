# Sales & Pilot Outreach Kit

Everything you need to acquire your first 10 agency customers for pilot.

## 📧 Email Sequence

### Email 1: Cold Outreach (Day 0)

Subject: *Free brand strategy tool (takes 5 min)*

```
Hi [Name],

I built something for agencies like yours: an AI tool that generates complete brand strategies in minutes.

Instead of spending weeks on research, you get:
✅ Competitive analysis
✅ Target audience insights
✅ Brand positioning statements
✅ Messaging frameworks
✅ All in one PDF report

Free trial: https://horizon-brand-builder.app (5 free runs, no card needed)

Usually I charge agencies $99-499/month for this capability. But I'm looking for 10 pilot customers to refine the product.

Interested? Let me know and I'll walk you through it.

Best,

### Email 2: Follow-up (Day 3)

Subject: *Re: Free brand strategy tool — quick question*

```
Hey [Name],

Just wanted to follow up on my previous email. 

Quick question: What's the biggest bottleneck in your brand work right now?

Is it:
- Finding time for research?
- Generating insights fast enough?
- Client expectations on turnaround time?
- Cost of hiring strategy consultants?

I'm building this specifically to solve one of these problems, so your input would be super helpful.

Either way, the free trial is live at https://horizon-brand-builder.app

Cheers,
[Your Name]
